T8ballBot is a simplistic magic 8ball bot that utilizes twitter4j and the twitter API.

If tweeted to with "@yourTwitterAcount #8ball "Your question"" it will answer with a prediction.

See config.txt for specifics the program needs to run propperly. Do note that the program heavily relies on keeping a log of all the tweets it has answered (due to a weakness in the twitter API on time filtering). So make sure to back that one up.
